<h1>Jamco</h1>

Jamco is a high school project started by four students with the idea to develop a social media website focused on communities. Communities being groups of people with common musical taste, that would allow them to interact between each other sharing playlists, chatting, and reviewing songs. This isn't really a new idea, but we thought that if the result ever got to a reasonably mature state, it would've definitely been fun to test it inside the school.

Although in the end we didn't get to finish the project (nor really start adding the most interesting features), we definitely learned a lot throughout the journey. This includes technical aspects about developing a website (in this case, PHP, but we are aware a framework would've made our job much easier), working in a team, and planning ahead to avoid headaches in the future. 

Jamco was one of the most significant projects in our last year of high school, and maybe someday, someone will decide to retake it for development, to see at least how far the idea ~and extremely dubious code base~ can reach.
